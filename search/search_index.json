The behavior depends on whether the object is mutable or immutable. Modifications to mutable objects can affect the original outside the function, while modifications to immutable objects create new objects, leaving the original unchanged.   </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"preparation/python-interview-questions-for-experienced/#16-what-are-iterators-in-python","title":"16.

What is Scope in Python?","text":"<p>In Python, the term \"scope\" refers to the region or context in a program where a particular identifier (like a variable or a function) is recognized and can be accessed. Python has different types of scopes, and the rules governing how variables are assigned and accessed depend on the scope in which they are defined. The two main types of scopes in Python are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Local Scope:</p> <ul> <li>A local scope refers to the region within a function where a variable is defined.   </li> <li>Variables created inside a function have a local scope and are only accessible within that function.   </li> <li>Once the function execution is complete, the local variables are destroyed, and their scope ends.   </li> </ul> example.py<pre><code>def example_function():\n    x = 10  # Local variable\n    print(x)\n\nexample_function()  # Prints 10\n# Accessing x here would result in an error since it's a local variable\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Global Scope: </p> <ul> <li>A global scope refers to the outermost level of a Python program, outside any function.   </li> <li>Variables defined at this level have a global scope and can be accessed from any part of the program.   </li> <li>Global variables persist throughout the lifetime of the program.   </li> </ul> example.py<pre><code>y = 20  # Global variable\n\ndef another_function():\n    print(y)\n\nanother_function()  # Prints 20\n# Accessing y here is allowed since it's a global variable\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to local and global scopes, Python also has a concept of \"enclosing\" or \"nested\" scopes, which occurs when there are nested functions. In this case, a variable can be in the local scope of one function and in the enclosing scope of another:   </p> example.py<pre><code>def outer_function():\n    z = 30  # Enclosing scope variable\n\n    def inner_function():\n        print(z)\n\n    inner_function()  # Prints 30\n\nouter_function()\n# Accessing z here would result in an error since it's in the enclosing scope of inner_function\n</code></pre> <p>Python follows the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in) rule to determine the order in which it looks for a variable. It first looks in the local scope, then the enclosing scope (if any), followed by the global scope, and finally the built-in scope where Python's built-in functions and objects reside. Understanding scope is crucial for writing code that behaves as expected and for avoiding naming conflicts between different parts of a program.   </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"preparation/python-interview-questions-for-freshers/#6-what-are-lists-and-tuples-what-is-the-key-difference-between-the-two","title":"6.

Why is finalize used?","text":"<p>In Python, the <code>__del__</code> method, also known as the \"finalizer\" or \"destructor,\" is used for garbage collection and cleanup. However, it's important to note that relying on <code>__del__</code> for cleanup purposes has some limitations and may not be the best practice in all scenarios.</p> <p>__del__ Method:</p> <p>The <code>__del__</code> method is automatically called by the Python interpreter when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when there are no more references to the object. It can be used to perform cleanup actions such as releasing resources (closing files, network connections, etc.) associated with the object.</p> <p>Example: </p> <p>example.py<pre><code>class MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        print(f\"{self.name} created\")\n\n    def __del__(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} destroyed\")\n\n# Creating instances of the class\nobj1 = MyClass(\"Object 1\")\nobj2 = MyClass(\"Object 2\")\n\n# Deleting references to the objects\ndel obj1\ndel obj2\n</code></pre> Output: </p> <pre><code>Object 1 created\nObject 2 created\nObject 1 destroyed\nObject 2 destroyed\n</code></pre> <p>Limitations and Alternatives:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Timing of Execution:</p> <ul> <li>The timing of when <code>__del__</code> is called is not guaranteed. It depends on the garbage collector, and the exact time of execution may be unpredictable. This makes it less reliable for critical cleanup tasks.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Circular References:</p> <ul> <li><code>__del__</code> may not be called in the presence of circular references (objects referencing each other), as the garbage collector might not be able to determine the correct order of destruction.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Context Managers ( <code>with</code> statement):</p> <ul> <li>For resource cleanup, it is often better to use context managers (implemented using the <code>with</code> statement) or the <code>try</code>- <code>finally</code> block to ensure that cleanup code is executed regardless of exceptions or other issues.   </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Example using context manager:   </p> example.py<pre><code>class FileHandler:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        print(\"Opening file\")\n        # Additional setup, if needed\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        print(\"Closing file\")\n        # Additional cleanup, if needed\n\n# Using the context manager\nwith FileHandler() as file_handler:\n    # Code block where file is open and used\n    print(\"File is being used\")\n# File is automatically closed upon exiting the block\n</code></pre> <p>Using context managers provides a more controlled and deterministic way to manage resources and cleanup operations.</p> <p>In summary, while <code>__del__</code> can be used for cleanup, it has limitations and may not be the best approach for critical resource management.
